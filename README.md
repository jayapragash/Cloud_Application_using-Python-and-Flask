# Cloud based Data Management Application

A cloud based project which uses python and Flask Framework to create a web application. Using this application you can upload csv files and manipulate the data, query them and visualize the result. I have used earthquake data set and the famous titanic data set for querying. This application was deployed in AWS where I performed scaling to handle the load on the website and tested it using Apache Jmeter.
